# spike-s1-t4-chatroom-nextjs
Chatroom app based on the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc, but created with the Nextjs framework instead of pure React.

# usage
To run the server, use **npm run devsite** (**npm build** first if error message shows)
To run client, use **npm run dev**. Client requires server running to work.
