# spike-s1-t4-chatroom-nextjs
Same chatroom app from the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc, but created with the Nextjs framework instead of pure React.

To run the server, use npm run devsite (npm build first if error message shows)
To run client, use npm run dev. Client requires server running to work.
